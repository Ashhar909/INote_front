Got to know that thunk is important for doing async tasks
thunk is a middleware for redux store 
that can hault an action before it is dispatched
also called the store enhancer

    npm i redux-thunk
    import
    insite createstore (reducer, applyMiddleware(thunk))
    ** now instead of objects the action creators can return a callback function that is async in nature
    ** previous return
    const fn = () => {
        return{
            type: "DO",
            msg: "msg"
        }
    }

    const fn = () => {
        return async(dispatch) => {
            // do some async action
            dispatch({
                type: "DO",
                msg: "msg"
            })
            
        }
    }
